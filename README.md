# Threat Detection Service

We are focused on delievering a Threat Detection Service for Detroit Schools and Detroit Neighborhoods, but the platform could be used for different purposes.  

We are focued on schools because they need to have efficent networks with the increased use of online testing.  We believe that a large portion of the schools bandwidth is being utilzied by hackers trying to take control of machines on the network to commit cyberattacks against others.  Also, there are computer viruses that install as ransomware where they pose as legitimate anti-virus software, but really they are just trying to obtain credit card numbers by having the user purchase fake virus software.

In Detroit Neighborhoods we are not focused on detecting cyberattacks, but we are focused on dectecting suspensious behaviour that may threaten the safty of Detroit residents.

Our Threat Detection Service is using [Apache Metron](http://metron.incubator.apache.org/) as the core engine
